TODO:
+ spatial selection: can split a trip into two or more trips
+ use spDists() to compute distances
+ point Jinlong to intro to S4 classes
+ look at spacetime/R/coerce.R: there the STTDF coercion function are defined
+ look at spacetime/R/STTDF-methods.R: there the STTDF creation and methods
  are defined.
+ understand how do.call and lapply work, e.g. in STTDF-methods.R

learn S4 from:

+ Jinlong will study the two overlay vignettes, in sp and spacetime.

+ next telco Jun 25, 16:00 CET
