TODO:
+ spatial selection: can split a trip into two or more trips
+ use spDists() to compute distances
+ point Jinlong to intro to S4 classes
+ look at spacetime/R/coerce.R: there the STTDF coercion function are defined
+ look at spacetime/R/STTDF-methods.R: there the STTDF creation and methods
  are defined.
+ understand how do.call and lapply work, e.g. in STTDF-methods.R

learn S4 from:
[16:54:19] Edzer Pebesma: https://github.com/hadley/devtools/wiki

commit code to the trajectory package on:
[16:56:16] Edzer Pebesma: https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/spacetime/

+ Jinlong will study the two overlay vignettes, in sp and spacetime.

+ next telco Jun 25, 16:00 CET

Weekly Report 1:

Status:

- First (unsuccessful) take on developing spatial and temporal selection operations. These operations will be revised later to make use of classes and methods that currently available in spacetime and sp packages.

- Set up subversion control in RStudio and start to commit
(I started to use Mac from this week. The subversion on my Mac is working, but not on my PC. I will figure out how to set up subversion control on PC later next week).

- Studied the overlay and aggregate vignettes from sp package (see links below). Learned the operations of space, time, and space-time overlay/aggreation realized by over() and aggregate() methods.
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/vignettes/over.pdf
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spacetime/vignettes/sto.pdf

- Studied section "SoftwareSystems", "The S3 object system", and "The S4 object system" from
Advanced R development: making reusable code (link: https://github.com/hadley/devtools/wiki). Learned the major differences between S3 and S4 objects (formal class definitions & multiple dispatch) and how to create/modify S4 objects.

- Learned how do.call and lapply works from spacetime/R/STTDF-methods.R

- Learned how STTDF objects are coerced from ltraj objects from spacetime/R/coerce.R


Problems:

- TBA


Task for next week:

- Set up subversion on control on my PC;
- TBA
